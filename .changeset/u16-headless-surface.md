The editor operator registry is now a closed table. `EditorOperatorRegistry`, `createEditorOperatorRegistry`, and `registerCoreOperators` are removed in favor of `operators`, `OperatorId`, `parseOperatorId`, `listOperators`, and `runOperator`. Captions, silence cuts, lint, and platform presets moved out of the CLI into `@mcut/editor` and `@mcut/transcription` as pure functions with zod input schemas, and the MCP server exposes them as the `apply_captions`, `apply_silence_cuts`, `lint_project`, and `list_presets` tools. `McutMcpTarget` gains `applyCommands`, and the `operators` option on `createMcutMcpServer` is gone.
